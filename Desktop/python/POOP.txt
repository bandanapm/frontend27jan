To create class we have to name it with capital letter
For ex: To create class name car
syntax:
class Car:


Inside car if we need to create object then use 
the folling syntax to create object
def __init__(self):

IF we need to create some object for car like make, model, year, color
Then do this 
def __init__(self,make,model,year,color):
	self.make = make
	self.model = model
	self.year = year
	self.color = color



If we want to create some methods like what car do 
run, stop
def run(self):
	Printf("IT is running")

def stopped(self):
	Printf("IT is stopping")


Lets create car1
car_1 = Car("Band","1231F",2023,"blue")

print(car_1.make)
print(car_1.model)
print(car_1.year)
print(car_1.color)

car_1.run()
car_1.stop()
