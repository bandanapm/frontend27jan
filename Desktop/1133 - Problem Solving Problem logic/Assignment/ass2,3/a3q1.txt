//Taking two inputs from user and checking the condition where the divided value given by user is less than 0 or equal to 0 or greater than 0. Consider the equation AX^2+B=0

//Declare var
Declare A As Float
Declare B As Float
 
//Take user input
Write "Please enter any number"
Input A

//Take user input
Write "Please enter another number"
Input B

//Checking Conditions and Output
If B/A < 0  
	Set X1 = Sqrt(–B/A) //Calculating and assigning values 
	Set X2 = −Sqrt(–B/A)
	Write "This equation has two solutions. The solutions are: " + X1 + " and " + X2
Else If B/A = 0 
	Set X = 0
	Write "This equation has one solution which is X = 0."
Else
	Write "This equation has no real number solutions."
End If
