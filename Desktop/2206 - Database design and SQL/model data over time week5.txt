Model data over time
-> Additional requirements need to keep historical data 
-> If we want to add new data to the database then to add new data for the same person we add the start date and end date that the person changes their data in the database without losing the old value.
-> Then there is a duplication in the employee id because the employee is the same so in the salary table we add the employee ID as a foreign key and primary key
